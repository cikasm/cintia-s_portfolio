# Data Analysis with R: Bellabeat Case Study
Capstone project completed as part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate

## Project Overview

The data analysis project aimed to analyze smart device fitness data to provide insights into how non-consumers of a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women use smart devices. By analyzing various aspects of usage data, the business task was to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and inform the company's marketing strategy.

### Data Sources

The primary data source for this analysis was the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), a Public Domain dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes information about usersâ€™ fitness activities, sleep patterns, heart rate, and other relevant metrics tracked by FitBit devices. The data was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016, and include 18 CSV files

## Data Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Install and load packages
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Removing duplicates and missing values
4. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the smart device fitness data to answer key questions, such as:

* What is the overall usage trend?
* What is the relationship between range of daily step counts and sleep duration?
